# About Me
Hello I'm just some random internet guy codes random stuff during boredom. And that lead to me creating some amazing shit.

# Works

## [MBRewind](https://github.com/RandomityGuy/MBRewind)
This is a plugin source for the mod for Marble Blast Gold that enables rewind functionality. A huge amount of engine hacks and reverse engineering went into its making. I'm proud of making such a Time Machine for marble blast.  
I also ported most of the rewind functionalities to the [Marble Blast Gold Web Port](https://github.com/Vanilagy/MarbleBlast). Here's the [link](https://github.com/RandomityGuy/MBG-Web-Rewind)

## [io_dif](https://github.com/RandomityGuy/io_dif)
This is a blender plugin to load Torque Game Engine interiors in blender and export Marble Blast compatible interiors. It works epic, except sometimes it doesnt. It is powered by my fork of DifBuilder by HiGuy that I improved a lot to add the remaining bare minimum functionality.

## [hxDif](https://github.com/RandomityGuy/hxDIF)
So yeah, I wrote a dif import library in Haxe so you can just stop writing your own dif parsers in different languages and just use this.


## [Dif.Net](https://github.com/RandomityGuy/Dif.Net)
A DIF import/export library but in C#. It's just a clone of DifBuilder but written better. I recommend.

## [obj2difPlus](https://github.com/RandomityGuy/obj2difPlus)
A working converter to convert Obj model files to Marble Blast compatible Dif interiors. It's pretty fast and efficient. Utilizes odd algorithms in its workings that, don't work anywhere outside MB.

## [obj2csx](https://github.com/RandomityGuy/obj2csx)
A tool to convert obj files to constructor exportable csx files. Constructor was never trash. People just didnt know how to utilize its full potential. This tool maximizes its capability and allows it to export whatever twists and turns you give it to it.

## [Marble Mission Manager](https://github.com/RandomityGuy/Marble-Mission-Manager)
This is just a CLI tool for browsing [http://cla.higuy.me](http://cla.higuy.me). APT style, with mission installation features and such.

## [ClaSearcher](https://github.com/RandomityGuy/ClaSearcher)
GUI tool to browse the marble blast custom level archive at [http://cla.higuy.me](http://cla.higuy.me). Inspired by Atmosphir's own level browser.

## [Missioneer](https://github.com/RandomityGuy/Missioneer)
A C# Library to generate and parse Marble Blast Mis files. Well I can't guarantee it can load every single mis because of the possibility that it contains custom code. It's the first Marble Blast project I have ever worked on

## [Octree](https://github.com/RandomityGuy/Octree)
So yeah I tried implementing an Octree data structure on my own for KNN searches. It works..I guess?

## [SimpleMono3D](https://github.com/RandomityGuy/SimpleMono3D)
I tried my hand on creating a simple easy to use 3D engine for quick prototypes and stuff. Basically I wanted Three.js's simplicity combined with C#'s powerful features and UI. It remains forever incomplete as I have lost the motivation to work on it.
